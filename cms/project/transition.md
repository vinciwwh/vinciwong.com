f_subtitle: Generative Images To Reality
f_paragraph: >-
  The realm of architectural design is continually evolving, driven by advancing
  technology and desiring to push the boundaries of creativity. Among these
  technological advancements, image generators have emerged as a promising tool
  for designers, offering efficiency and inspiration in generating design ideas,
  providing potentially wide range of design concepts within limited timeframes.
  However, it is crucial to critically evaluate the quality of generative
  images, as this novel technology challenges traditional design methodologies
  and raises questions about the level of training and limitations within
  machine learning algorithms. Hence, this research project aims to
  experimentally investigate the translation process from 2D images to 3D models
  in architectural design, with the objective of identifying the gaps in this
  transition and uncovering new possibilities for constructing a novel typology
  of architectural elements.
